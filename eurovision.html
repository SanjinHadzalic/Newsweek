                International performers have gathered in Tel Aviv for one of the world's most popular talent shows, but the 2019 Eurovision Song Contest​ comes after a spike in violence that has defined the decades-long conflict between Israelis and Palestinians.
                <br><br>
                The singing contest is just one of many high-profile events occurring in the Middle East this May, a month marked with a great deal of history for Israel, a young country with borders that have still yet to be defined. On Tuesday, Israel celebrated its 71st Independence Day, marking the beginning of the world's only Jewish-majority country. On Wednesday, Palestinians also recognized the 71st anniversary of the Nakba, referring to the "catastrophe" ensuing from the mass displacement of Palestinians that reflected a very different history of Israel's founding in 1948.
                <br><br>
                The dueling narratives have become an intrinsic part of Israel's image, both at home and abroad, and clashes between the two sides turned fatal earlier this month. Several Palestinians were killed while demonstrating at the border of the Gaza Strip and in airstrikes, to which Islamist Palestinian militant group Hamas responded with its biggest barrage of rockets against Israel since the two sides went to war in 2014. Israel responded with its own massive show of force, causing death and destruction in new airstrikes on the small Palestinian-controlled enclave.
                <br><br>
                Then, however, came a quick calm, a rare occurrence in the storied Israeli-Palestinian conflict. And while Eurovision may come to dominate international coverage of Israel on Saturday, at home, peace is as far away as ever.           
                <br><br>
                Ido Aharoni, a former soldier with 25 year of service at the Israeli Foreign Ministry and who recently served as Israel's consul general in New York, told Newsweek that, "Israel's overall security doctrine, established in the early days of the state, proved to be a big success."
                <br><br>
                He identified the three main branches of this strategy asbuilding a big military, pre-emptive strikes and deterring threats via advanced weapons systems, such as the Iron Dome that intercepted a number of incoming rockets earlier this month.
                <br><br>
                Aharoni claimed Palestinians adopted a "soft underbelly doctrine," which he described as, "Attacking Israel, not necessarily in order to destroy the country, but to effectively diminish the value of its brand and its main civilian assets." Such targets, he said, include Israel's "seven consecutive record-breaking years in tourism, dramatic rise in direct foreign investment and global recognition in the country's creative prowess."
